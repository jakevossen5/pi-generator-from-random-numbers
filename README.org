#+TITLE: pi-generator-from-random-numbers

This program generates random numbers, and calculates Pi based off the
odds that those two numbers are [[Generates Pi from random numbers and co-primes][co-prime]]. This was mostly just an
excuse for me to learn concurrency in Rust, which I was fairly
successful with. Change the ~num_runs~ variable to increase or
decrease the number of trials.

This was inspired by [[https://youtu.be/RZBhSi_PwHU][this]] video by Matt Parker.

elastic collisions.
